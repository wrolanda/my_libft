libft library ecole42
You must write your own function implementing the following original ones. They do
not require any external functions:
• isalpha
• isdigit
• isalnum
• isascii
• isprint
• strlen
• memset
• bzero
• memcpy
• memmove
• strlcpy
• strlcat
• toupper
• tolower
• strchr
• strrchr
• strncmp
• memchr
• memcmp
• strnstr
• atoi

In order to implement the two following functions, you will use malloc():
• calloc
• strdup

 Part 2 - Additional functions
• ft_substr - Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a substring
from the string ’s’. The substring begins at index ’start’ and is of
maximum size ’len’.

• ft_strjoin - Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new
string, which is the result of the concatenation
of ’s1’ and ’s2’.

• ft_strtrim - Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a copy of
’s1’ with the characters specified in ’set’ removed
from the beginning and the end of the string.

• ft_split - Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns an array
of strings obtained by splitting ’s’ using the
character ’c’ as a delimiter. The array must end
with a NULL pointer.

• ft_itoa - Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a string
representing the integer received as an argument.
Negative numbers must be handled.

• ft_strmapi - Applies the function ’f’ to each character of the
string ’s’, and passing its index as first argument
to create a new string (with malloc(3)) resulting
from successive applications of ’f’.

• ft_striteri - Applies the function ’f’ on each character of
the string passed as argument, passing its index
as first argument. Each character is passed by
address to ’f’ to be modified if necessary.

• ft_putchar_fd - Outputs the character ’c’ to the given file
descriptor.

• ft_putstr_fd - Outputs the string ’s’ to the given file
descriptor

• ft_putendl_fd - Outputs the string ’s’ to the given file descriptor
followed by a newline.

• ft_putnbr_fd - Outputs the integer ’n’ to the given file
descriptor.

Bonus part
• ft_lstnew - Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new node.
The member variable ’content’ is initialized with
the value of the parameter ’content’. The variable
’next’ is initialized to NULL.

• ft_lstadd_front - Adds the node ’new’ at the beginning of the list.

• ft_lstsize - Counts the number of nodes in a list.

• ft_lstlast - Returns the last node of the list.

• ft_lstadd_back - Adds the node ’new’ at the end of the list.

• ft_lstdelone - Takes as a parameter a node and frees the memory of
the node’s content using the function ’del’ given
as a parameter and free the node. The memory of
’next’ must not be freed.

• ft_lstclear - Deletes and frees the given node and every
successor of that node, using the function ’del’
and free(3).
Finally, the pointer to the list must be set to
NULL.

• ft_lstiter - Iterates the list ’lst’ and applies the function
’f’ on the content of each node.

• ft_lstmap - Iterates the list ’lst’ and applies the function
’f’ on the content of each node. Creates a new
list resulting of the successive applications of
the function ’f’. The ’del’ function is used to
delete the content of a node if needed.
